# Cassava Leaf Disease Classification

This competition, sponsored by the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala, involves using a dataset with 21,367 labelled images to create a classifier. Said classifier must be able to determine if the plant is healthy, or if it has one of four disease categories.

My workbooks can either be accessed via this github or via the links below. The use of two separate notebooks are due to competition code rules that limit internet access and tensor processing unit (TPU) access to training only.
